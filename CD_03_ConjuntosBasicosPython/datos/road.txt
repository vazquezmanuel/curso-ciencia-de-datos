Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
and sorry I could not travel both
and be one traveler long I stood
and looked down one as far as I could
to where it bent in the undergrowth
then took the other as just as fair
and having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same
